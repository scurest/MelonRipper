This repo has some stuff for ripping 3D models from the Nintendo DS.
It works Ninja Ripper-style,
where to rip a model, you play in an emulator
until the model is on screen,
then press a key to dump everything drawn in one frame to a file.
A Blender addon can import the dump.

If you want to convert an .nsbmd model file instead,
I have [another project](https://github.com/scurest/apicula)
for that.

## How it works

MelonRipper consists of two parts:
a patched melonDS for ripping dump files,
and a Blender addon for importing them.

### melonDS

First, you need to compile the patched melonDS.
Fetch the branch [scurest:MelonRipper](https://github.com/scurest/melonDS/tree/MelonRipper)
and build it normally.
Build instructions are in melonDS's ReadMe.

<table><tbody><tr><td>
For Windows users, you can also download a
<a href="https://github.com/scurest/melonDS/releases/tag/MelonRipperBuild">precompiled EXE</a>.
</td></tr></tbody></table>

melonDS requires firmware to run games
so make sure that's installed.
Again, see the ReadMe for how that works.

Okay, so you've got your patched melonDS running now.
The patch will have added a new hotkey for ripping a frame.
Go to _Config ‣ Input and hotkeys ‣ Add-ons_
and assign a hotkey to "[MelonRipper] Rip"
(I used [F]).

Then when you are playing a game
press your hotkey to rip everything drawn on the next frame.
The rip is saved to a file named like
`melonrip-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.dump`
in the current directory.

### Blender

You'll need Blender 2.82 or later.

Install the [`import_melon_rip.py`](import_melon_rip.py) file
through _Edit ‣ Preferences ‣ Add-ons ‣ Install..._
and enable the addon "Import: MelonRipper NDS Dumps".
(See the [Blender Manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#rd-party-add-ons)
or [this question](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/1688/installing-an-addon/1689)
if you need help installing addons.)

Then go to _File ‣ Import ‣ MelonRipper NDS Dump_
and pick the `.dump` file you ripped with melonDS
to import it.


## Tips and other stuff to know

* If the colors are washed out, you probably need to
  switch Blender's color space from "Filmic" to "Standard".
  See [this answer](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/164677/images-as-emitters-constantly-come-out-dull-white-emission-not-actually-white).
  (btw I recommend saving this change to your startup file.)

* If you're having trouble finding the model in Blender,
  try _View ‣ Frame Selected_ in the 3D View
  to fit the selected model into the viewport.
  Walk mode is also useful for navigation.

* Sometimes different parts of the scene are
  displaced relative to each other.
  I think that's because they're drawn with different "cameras".
  (Dumped vertex position are all after the ModelView matrix
  but before the Projection.)

* Normals aren't ripped.
  The calculated lighting from normals is baked into the vertex colors.

* Strip connectivity is not preserved.
  All faces in Blender are totally separate from each other,
  even if they were originally part of a polygon strip.

* Vertex colors in the middle of a quad
  will look different in Blender than on the DS
  because quads on a PC are rendered as two tris,
  while the DS renders quads as real quads.
  The [melonDS blog](http://melonds.kuribo64.net/comments.php?id=122)
  has a great explanation for this.

* Translucent (partially transparent) faces are imported with "Alpha Blend".
  This may have sorting problems in the Eevee renderer.
  If you have sorting issues, try Cycles.

* The material nodes are supposed to simulate a DS pixel pipeline.
  Implemented effects: texturing, modulate, decal, toon, texcoord wrapping.
  Unimplemented: fog, shadow, wireframe, edgemarking, depth equal, rear plane.

* Exporting to .gltf sort of works (use Blender ≥2.92 for best results).
  Exporting to .dae or .fbx loses the materials.
  Exporting to .obj loses the materials and the vertex colors!
